## What is Pretix?

Pretix is a ticketing platform that allows event organizers to sell tickets for their events online. It provides a simple and flexible interface for creating and managing events, ticket types, prices, and sales.

We are using Pretix to manage the creation of Sub-Events, we can easily create separate ticket types for each Sub-Event and customize the pricing and availability for each one. Additionally, we can track sales data and stats in real-time.

## How to create a Sub-Event on Pretix?

No need! All Sub-Events are already created by Zuzaluâ€™s team. This frees up more time for you to focus on other important aspects of your event.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the Zuzalu team.<span style="color:red">**add contact link**</span>

## How I can access my Pretix account and see my Sub-Events already created?

To access your Sub-Events on Pretix, you should have received an email from the Zuzalu team with an authorization link to validate your email and gain access to your account.
