# Understanding the "Create a Session" Form Fields

When creating a session on the Zuzalu website, you will be prompted to fill out a form with various fields. This guide will explain the purpose and significance of each field to help you better understand how to complete the form accurately.

### Event Name

The event name field is where you enter the title of your session. Choose a name that is descriptive and accurately represents the theme or topic of your session. The event name will be displayed on the "Full Program" page and will be the first thing attendees see when browsing available sessions.

### Event Start Date

The event start date is the date when your session will begin. Ensure you choose the correct date for your session, as this information will be used by attendees to plan their schedule.

### Event End Date

The event end date is the date when your session will conclude. This field is important for multi-day sessions, as it helps attendees know the duration of the event. If your session is only one day, the event end date should be the same as the event start date.

### Location

The location field is where you input the physical address or venue where the session will take place. Providing accurate location information will help attendees plan their travel and accommodations accordingly.

### Organizers

In the organizers field, list the names or organizations responsible for hosting the session. This information helps attendees know who is responsible for the session and can also provide credibility to the session.

### Tags

Tags are keywords that help categorize and identify the session's theme, topic, or industry. These tags will make it easier for attendees to find sessions that match their interests. Include relevant tags that accurately represent your session.

### Additional Information

The additional information field is where you can provide any extra details about your session that may not fit into the other fields. This could include information about guest speakers, special requirements for attendees, or any other relevant information that would be useful for potential attendees to know.

By filling out these fields accurately and thoroughly, you can create a comprehensive session listing that provides all the necessary information for attendees. This will help ensure a successful event and make it easy for interested individuals to find and join your session.
