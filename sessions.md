# Creating Your First Session: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Getting Started

Whether you're a Zuzalu Citizen or a Sub-Event Organizer, the process for creating a Session (Open Session or Event Session) is quite similar. This guide is designed to assist you throughout the process.

This step-by-step tutorial will provide you with all the information you need to create sessions. Let's get started!

## 1. Generate Your Passport

Before you can create and manage sessions on the Zuzalu website, you need to have an account and be logged in. To ensure privacy and security, Zuzalu uses the Passport authentication. Follow the steps below to create your Passport and log in to the Zuzalu.

1. Visit the Passport creation website at https://pcd-passport.com/ <span style="color:red">**TBC**</span>
2. On the main page, you'll see a form to enter the required information, such as your name and email address. Make sure to use a valid email, as you may need to verify it later, then click on “Generate Passport”. It should look like that:

3. Once your Passport is successfully created, you'll receive an email confirmation. Make sure you have created a Paasassport properly, as you'll need it to log in to the Zuzalu platform.

## 2. Log in to Zuzalu Using Your Passport

1. Visit the Zuzalu's website at: <span style="color:red">**TBU**</span>. Select the "Connect with Passport" option. It’s on the top right side of the page, here is an example:

3. The platform will automatically redirect to a page to retrieve your information from the Passport system, creating an account for you if you don't have one already.
4. Once you've successfully connected your Passport, you'll be redirected to the Zuzalu platform's main dashboard.

Now that you're logged in to the Zuzalu platform, you can start creating and managing sessions. Continue to the next section of this tutorial to learn how to create a session.

4. In the second step of the session creation process, you'll be prompted to set up tickets for your event. Configure your ticket settings, such as name, description, and quantity. After filling out the details, click "Add Ticket" to generate your ticket.
5. Once you've added your ticket, proceed to the final step, where you'll be asked to review and confirm the session and ticket details. If necessary, you can go back to previous steps to edit information. If everything looks correct, click on "Confirm Session."

After confirmation, your session will be displayed on the "Full Program" page alongside other sessions. Zuzalu citizens can now RSVP or get tickets for your session.
